// Purpose
(1) read in and parse files defining the dimensions of a game board,the locations of different pieces on the board, and the symbols used to display the pieces on a game board; 
(2) recognize badly formatted inputs that the program can handle and then still proceed (e.g., by skipping over a badly formed line in an input file), but have the program exit gracefully if (and only if) it encounters a case it cannot handle (such as not being able to open the input file at all,or not being able to extract dimensions of the game board from the file);
(3) if information gathering from the file succeeded, print out a representation of the game board and the pieces on it.
